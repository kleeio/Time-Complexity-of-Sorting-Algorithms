# Time-Complexity-of-Sorting-Algorithms
For Assignment 1 of CS245: Data Structures and Algorithm with Professor Brizan.

Sort Interface is implemented by each sorting algorithm, which contains functions ```sort(<double_array>)``` and ```isSorted(<double_array>)```. 
By uncommenting the main method in Sort.java, the runtime result of the six sorting algorithms in milliseconds will be printed to console.

To run Sort.java:
  ```java Sort <desired-array-length>```

Navigate to the Issues tab to read more about the time complexities of these sorting algorithms.
